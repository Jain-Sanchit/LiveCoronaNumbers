            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><u><strong>Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus</strong></u>
            </h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align:left;">Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                available
                on the WHO website and through your
                national
                and local public health authority. Most people who become infected experience mild illness and recover,
                but
                it can be
                more severe for others. Take care of your health and protect others by doing the following:
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><u><strong>Wash your hands frequently</strong> </u></h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align:left;">Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based
                hand
                rub
                or wash them with soap and water.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Why?</strong> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills
                viruses
                that
                may be on your hands.</p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><u><strong>Maintain social distancing</strong> </u></h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align:left;">
                Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Why?</strong> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or
                mouth
                which may contain virus.
                If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person
                coughing
                has
                the
                disease.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><u><strong>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</strong> </u></h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align:left;">
                <strong>Why?</strong> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can
                transfer
                the virus to your eyes,
                nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><u><strong>Practice respiratory hygiene</strong></u></h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align:left;">
                Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your
                mouth
                and
                nose with
                your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Why?</strong> Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the
                people
                around
                you from viruses such as
                cold, flu and COVID-19.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><u><strong>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
                        care
                        early</strong></u></h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align:left;">
                Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
                attention
                and
                call in
                advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Why?</strong> National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the
                situation
                in your area. Calling in
                advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This
                will
                also
                protect
                you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><u><strong>Stay informed and follow advice given by your healthcare
                        provider</strong></u></h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align:left;">
                Stay informed on the latest developments about COVID-19. Follow advice given by your healthcare
                provider,
                your
                national
                and local public health authority or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Why?</strong> National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on
                whether
                COVID-19 is spreading in your
                area. They are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.

                <h2>Travel precautions</h2>
                <br><br>
                <div>
                    All individuals planning travel should seek advice on the potential hazards in their chosen
                    destinations
                    and understand
                    how best to protect their health and minimize the risk of acquiring disease. Forward planning,
                    appropriate preparation
                    and careful precautions can protect their health and minimize the risks of accident and of acquiring
                    disease. Although
                    the medical profession and the travel industry can provide extensive help and sound advice, it
                    remains
                    the traveller’s
                    responsibility to seek information, to understand the risks involved and to take the necessary
                    precautions to protect
                    their health while travelling.

                    What are the health risks associated with travel?

                </div>
                <div class="anss">
                    Destinations where accommodation, hygiene and sanitation, medical care and water quality are of a
                    high standard pose
                    relatively few serious risks to the health of travellers, except those with pre-existing illness.
                    The same is true of
                    business travellers and tourists visiting most major cities and tourist centres and staying in
                    good-quality
                    accommodation. In contrast, destinations where accommodation is of poor quality, hygiene and
                    sanitation are inadequate,
                    medical services do not exist and clean water is unavailable may pose serious risks for the health
                    of travellers. This
                    applies, for example, to personnel from emergency relief and development agencies and to tourists
                    who venture into
                    remote areas. In these settings, stringent precautions must be taken to avoid illness. Travel
                    warnings from governmental
                    sources should be taken seriously; they are likely to have implications for travel and for travel
                    insurance.
                    <br><br>
                    Travellers and travel medicine practitioners should be aware of the diseases found in the
                    destination countries.
                    Unforeseen natural or human-made disasters may occur, and outbreaks of known or newly emerging
                    infectious diseases are
                    often unpredictable.
                    <br><br>
                    The mode of transport, duration of visit and the behaviour of the traveller are important can affect
                    the exposure to
                    infectious diseases and will influence decisions on the need for certain vaccinations or
                    antimalarial medication. The
                    duration of the visit may also determine whether the traveller is subjected to marked changes in
                    altitude, temperature
                    and humidity or to prolonged exposure to atmospheric pollution.
                    <br><br>
                    Understanding the purpose of the visit and the type of travel planned is critical in relation to the
                    associated travel
                    health risks. However, behaviour also plays an important role; for example, going outdoors in the
                    evenings in a
                    malaria-endemic area without taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites may result in the traveller
                    becoming infected
                    with malaria. Exposure to insects, rodents or other animals, infectious agents and contaminated food
                    and water, combined
                    with the absence of appropriate medical facilities, makes travel in many remote regions particularly
                    hazardous.
                    <br><br>
                    Whatever their destination or mode of travel, it is important that travellers be aware of the risk
                    of accidents under
                    the influence of alcohol or drugs and, mainly, in relation to road transport or the practice of
                    sports.

                    Should I see my doctor before I travel?

                <div class="anss">
                    Travellers intending to visit a destination in a developing country should consult a travel medicine
                    clinic or medical
                    practitioner before the journey. This consultation should take place at least 4–8 weeks before the
                    journey and
                    preferably earlier if long-term travel or overseas work is intended. However, last-minute travellers
                    can also benefit
                    from a medical consultation, even as late as the day of travel. The consultation will include
                    information about the most
                    important health risks (including traffic accidents), determine the need for any vaccinations and/or
                    antimalarial
                    medication and identify any other medical items that the traveller may require. A basic medical kit
                    will be prescribed
                    or provided, supplemented as appropriate to meet individual needs.
                    Dental, gynaecological and age-appropriate examinations are advisable before prolonged travel to
                    developing countries or
                    to remote areas. This is particularly important for people with chronic or recurrent health
                    problems. Travellers with
                    underlying medical problems are strongly advised to consult a travel medicine clinic or medical
                    practitioner to ensure
                    that their potentially complex travel health needs are met. All travellers should be strongly
                    advised to seek
                    comprehensive travel insurance.
                </div>
                <div class="quss">What risks are there for travellers with medical conditions and special needs?</div>
                <div class="anss">
                    Health risks associated with travel are greater for certain groups of travellers, including infants
                    and young children,
                    pregnant women, the elderly, the disabled, the immunocompromised and those who have pre-existing
                    health problems. Such
                    travellers are strongly recommended to seek specialist travel health advice.
                    <br><br> <strong>Age</strong><br><br>
                    Air travel may cause discomfort to infants as a result of changes in cabin air pressure and is not
                    advised for infants
                    less than 48 hours old. Infants and young children are particularly sensitive to sudden changes in
                    altitude and to
                    ultraviolet radiation. They have special needs with regard to vaccinations and antimalarial
                    precautions. They become
                    dehydrated more easily than adults in the event of inadequate fluid intake or loss of fluid as a
                    result of diarrhoea or
                    vomiting. Advanced age is not necessarily more dangerous for travel if the general health status is
                    good. Elderly people
                    should seek medical advice before planning long-distance travel.
                    <br><br><strong>Pregnancy</strong>

                    <br><br>
                    Travel is usually possible during pregnancy until close to the expected date of delivery, provided
                    that the pregnancy is
                    uncomplicated and the woman’s health is good. It is safest for pregnant women to travel during the
                    second trimester.
                    Airlines impose some travel restrictions in late pregnancy and in the neonatal period and it is
                    advisable for travellers
                    to check any restrictions directly with the relevant airline.
                    <br>
                    There are some restrictions on vaccination during pregnancy.
                    <br>
                    Pregnant women risk serious complications if they contract malaria or viral hepatitis E. Travel to
                    areas endemic for
                    these diseases should be avoided during pregnancy if possible.
                    <br>
                    Thromboembolic complications are more frequent during pregnancy.
                    <br>
                    Medication of any type during pregnancy should be taken only in accordance with medical advice.

                    Travel to sleeping altitudes over 3000 m or to remote areas is not advisable during pregnancy.
                    Disability
                    <br><br>
                    Physical disability is not usually a contraindication for travel if the general health status of the
                    traveller is good.
                    Airlines have regulations concerning travel for disabled passengers who need to be accompanied.
                    Information should be
                    obtained from the relevant airline well in advance of the intended travel.

                    <br><br><strong>Pre-existing illness</strong>

                    <br><br>
                    People suffering from underlying chronic illnesses should seek medical advice before planning a
                    journey.
